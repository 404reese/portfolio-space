      I&apos;m surfing the dual waves of Data Science & Statistics at IIT Madras and AI & DS at KJ Somaiya. Yes, I cleared my JEEs, hence I also minor in pulling all-nighters. Inveterate Web Developer yet an aspiring Machine Learning maestro on the scout for intriguing projects. You could say I&apos;m like a Doraemon in the tech universe, juggling from Web Dev, C, Java, DBMS to AOA. And oh, did I tell you I nailed a top 5 spot at school not once, but twice?  
<br></br><br></br>
College life saw me joining every possible committee, probably because I&apos;m insatiable when it comes to knowledge (or maybe it was for the free food!). From being a language maestro at the Professional Communication Skills Committee to the creative Picasso as the Head of Design Team for our college magazine, I&apos;ve done it all. and Yep, I&apos;m that person who&apos;s always tinkering, always pushing buttons just to see what happens next.
<br></br><br></br>
Now, here&apos;s where you come in: I&apos;m on the lookout for internships that promise as many learning curves as there are on a roller-coaster ride! Whether it&apos;s diving into cutting-edge ML projects or using AI to save the world (well, maybe just a small corner of it), I&apos;m ready to roll up my sleeves and get stuck in.
<br></br><br></br>
And hey, it&apos;s not all about the tech stuff. I&apos;m all about connecting with my fellow techies, swapping stories, and soaking up wisdom like a sponge at a water park. So, if you&apos;re as pumped about tech as I am, let&apos;s join forces. Together, we&apos;ll conquer code, shape the future, and maybe even have a bit of fun along the way. Reach out, and let&apos;s make some magic happen! âœ¨
